# IBM Differential Privacy

A comprehensive implementation and exploration of differential privacy techniques using IBM's Differential Privacy Library (Diffprivlib).

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of differential privacy mechanisms for machine learning and data analytics tasks. Differential privacy provides mathematical guarantees for protecting individual privacy while still allowing meaningful statistical analysis and machine learning on datasets.

**Differential privacy** adds carefully calibrated noise to data or algorithms to ensure that the output doesn't reveal information about any individual in the dataset, while maintaining the overall utility of the data for analysis.

## Features

- **Privacy Mechanisms**: Implementation of core differential privacy mechanisms including Laplace, Gaussian, and Exponential mechanisms
- **Machine Learning Models**: Differentially private versions of common ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering)
- **Privacy Budget Management**: Tools for tracking and managing privacy budget across multiple operations
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Differentially private statistical functions and data exploration utilities
- **Educational Examples**: Step-by-step tutorials and examples for learning differential privacy concepts

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip or conda package manager

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install the IBM Differential Privacy Library
pip install diffprivlib

# Install additional dependencies
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

### Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phantom2810/IBM-Differential-Privacy.git
cd IBM-Differential-Privacy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of training a differentially private classifier:

```python
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from diffprivlib.models import GaussianNB

# Load dataset
dataset = datasets.load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    dataset.data, dataset.target, test_size=0.2
)

# Train differentially private model
dp_clf = GaussianNB(epsilon=1.0)
dp_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
accuracy = dp_clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Differentially private accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

## Core Components

### 1. Privacy Mechanisms

The building blocks of differential privacy:

- **Laplace Mechanism**: Adds Laplace noise for ε-differential privacy
- **Gaussian Mechanism**: Adds Gaussian noise for (ε,δ)-differential privacy
- **Exponential Mechanism**: Selects outputs based on a utility function
- **Sparse Vector Technique**: Efficiently answers many queries

### 2. Machine Learning Models

Differentially private implementations of popular algorithms:

- **Classification**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Regression**: Linear Regression with objective perturbation
- **Clustering**: K-means with privacy guarantees
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 3. Privacy Budget Management

- **BudgetAccountant**: Track privacy loss across multiple operations
- **Composition Theorems**: Calculate total privacy loss using advanced composition
- **Privacy Analysis**: Tools for analyzing privacy guarantees

## Examples and Tutorials

### Basic Privacy Mechanisms

Explore fundamental differential privacy mechanisms:

```python
from diffprivlib.mechanisms import Laplace

# Add Laplace noise to a query result
mechanism = Laplace(epsilon=1.0, sensitivity=1.0)
private_result = mechanism.randomise(actual_count)
```

### Differentially Private Data Analysis

Perform statistical analysis with privacy guarantees:

```python
from diffprivlib.tools import histogram, mean

# Compute differentially private histogram
dp_hist = histogram(data, epsilon=1.0, bins=10)

# Calculate differentially private mean
dp_mean = mean(data, epsilon=0.5, bounds=(0, 100))
```

### Privacy Budget Management

Track privacy expenditure across multiple operations:

```python
from diffprivlib.accountant import BudgetAccountant

accountant = BudgetAccountant(epsilon=1.0, delta=1e-5)

# Spend budget on operations
with accountant:
    result1 = private_operation_1(data, epsilon=0.3)
    result2 = private_operation_2(data, epsilon=0.7)

print(f"Remaining budget: {accountant.remaining()}")
```

## Privacy Parameters

Understanding key differential privacy parameters:

- **ε (epsilon)**: Privacy parameter - smaller values mean stronger privacy
- **δ (delta)**: Failure probability - typically set to 1/n where n is dataset size
- **Sensitivity**: Maximum change in output when one record is added/removed
- **Privacy Budget**: Total amount of privacy loss allowed across all operations

## Use Cases

This project demonstrates differential privacy applications in:

- **Healthcare Data**: Analyzing medical records while protecting patient privacy
- **Financial Analytics**: Processing transaction data with privacy guarantees
- **Survey Research**: Publishing statistics from sensitive surveys
